        Intro
        --------
        jsontv downloads and generates television data from SchedulesDirect.org
        and parses it into python dicts (and lists). Simple usage is as follows:
        
        ::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from jsontv import SchedulesDirect
        
            schedule = SchedulesDirect('username', 'password') 
        
        You can see a full example in the ./examples folder of this project.
        
        Usage
        --------
        
        There a few cavets with it's current incarnation:
        
        * ScheduleDirect's current JSON API is VERY much in beta. Much could
          change in how data is sent to the client.
        * Because ScheduleDirect sends some data as plain text, and others as
          zip files, some functions return dicts or lists, while others return
          generators.
